# Dockerfile Best Practices
This example demonstrates an improved Dockerfile.  The original version used `ubuntu:latest`, which is considered bad practice because it is not a fixed version.  This makes builds inconsistent as the image can change unexpectedly.  Additionally, the original file lacked best practices for package management and robust execution of the main application.

**Issues Addressed:**

* **Base image:** Changed to a specific Ubuntu version for reproducibility.
* **Package management:** Improved `apt-get` commands to include `-y` for automatic confirmation, and cleanup using `&& apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove`.
* **Error handling:** Added checks for `apt-get` failure.
* **Entrypoint:** Made more robust to handle potential errors during application execution.  

**Solution Improvements:**
The improved Dockerfile uses a fixed Ubuntu version, cleaner package installation, and more reliable error handling.
